### Discovering a bug

> Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this  issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

### Squeezed down

> An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with the investor? In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that this could potentially happen less often?
